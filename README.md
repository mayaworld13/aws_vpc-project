<h1 align="center">AWS VPC Project Integrated With AutoScaling group and Application Load balancer</h1>

## Overview
This project involves setting up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and creating an auto-scaling group to manage EC2 instances. We will also set up a bastion host for secure access to private instances and create an application load balancer for distributing traffic.
